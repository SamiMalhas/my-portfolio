# Mandatory Pre-Prompt Rule Enforcement

Before processing any prompt or generating any code, ensure that you have reviewed and are in full compliance with all relevant Cursor rulesâ€”including both global guidelines and any applicable project rules.

## Checklist before proceeding:
- Verify the **Project Overview** guidelines (project purpose, key features, and tech stack).
- Confirm that **Documentation Sync Guidelines** are met (every code change must have a corresponding documentation update in the `/docs` folder).
- Ensure the **Folder Structure and File Naming** conventions are followed.
- Adhere to all **Development Best Practices** regarding code clarity, maintainability, reusability, code modularity and modular documentation.
- use the related MCP when needed.
- the theme of the project is neobrutalism.

## Action Required:
- Pause and re-evaluate your prompt or code if any of the guidelines above are not fully met.


This rule is mandatory and applies to every prompt or code generation within the IDE.
